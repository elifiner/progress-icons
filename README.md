Progress Icons
==============

This small script generates nice progress icons. I couldn't find nice separate progress icons online that were
free so we could use them on Slack to report progress on our tasks, so I wrote this little thing.

SVG versions are in `svg/`, PNG versions are in `png/`.

This script requires `svg2png` that can be installed with `npm install -g svg2png`.
